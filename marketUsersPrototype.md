# Market, Users, Prototype

## Understand Your Market
### *Provide links to the 3 websites you explored*
1. https://www.airbnb.com/
2. https://www.vrbo.com/
3. https://www.wimdu.com/

### *Briefly explain why these websites are a relevant comparison* 
These websites are a relevant comparison to our product, Homes & Villas by Marriott Bonvoy, as they are primarily focused and advertised on selling whole-home rentals. These whole-home rentals are presented as popular cities, experiences, or vacation sites where the location of one's stay matters. This is significant as our client's company aims to satisfy these exact needs of their customers. 

### *List at least 10 product features*
- a user can search by location, dates, and guests immediately when entering the website
- a user can look at suggested popular cities/locations immediately when entering the website
- a user can filter a particular search after the initial search
- a user can quickly save locations they like in a list/trip board
- a user can view their upcoming trips in their account page
- a user can browse through cards based on filterations showing the price, reviews, and image immediately
- a user can select cards to view more information, get contact info, and book the rental
- a user can share the rental through many media platforms
- a user can explore the location of potential rentals on a map
- a user can quickly change region/language in navbar to allow site to better accomidate them


## Understand Your Users
### *Write a short paragraph (50-100 words) describing the themes that emerged from the user research*
The user research suggests that the majority of our clinet's users have a good idea for the type of location they do or don't want, but do not have a destination in mind. Additionally, a large chunk of our clinet's users are looking for a location that they can relate to or inspires them to take that journey which varies from clinet to client. Many of Marriott Bonvoy members found that when the map or page is cluttered with too many options, the experience of exploring becomes daunting or tedious. These themes and futher research should improve the website to displaying types of getaways and inspirational material.



## Define and Prototype
### *Paste a link to your prototype here* 
*Don't forget to include a comment if you attempted any of the LevelUps, so that your grader knows to review your work and award the extra credit!* 
> **üóíÔ∏è NOTE:** Make sure you share your prototype file so that "anyone with the link" can view it. If we're unable to access your file, we'll be unable to give you credit.

Here is the link to the prototype using Google Slides. Make sure to view the slideshow "starting form the beginning" to skip instruction slides:

*Level ups*
- The high fidelity prototype uses graphics that will accurate to the website and supports high interactivity such as many buttons and scrolling. Only negative of prototype is not supporting beach and mountain buttons, but this oversight is permitted in task instructions. 
- The prototype provides an additional feature of closing the modal without having to choose a type of location. This is ideal for over 25% of our clinet's users that have an exact location in mind and would rather search in the search box.
